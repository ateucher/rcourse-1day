This one-day course will introduce users to [R](http://www.r-project.org/) software. This course is suitable for people who have never used R, as well those who may have used R in the past but need to brush up on the basics.

## What is R?

R is an open source programming language and environment for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and plotting. In addition to being free (as in speech, eg. open source) it is also free (as in free beer, yay!), which means you can download and use it for free. It works on all major operating systems including Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Course Content

- R basics including the R environment, basic data structures, and using functions
- Data input and output using .csv files
- Installation of external packages to extend R's capabilities
- Data manipulation using the "dplyr" package
- Plotting data using the "ggplot2" package
- Introduction to using R for statistical analysis

You will be issued a signed certificate of completion at the end of the course.

\*\**Note that this will not be a statistics course, but an introduction on how to use the program **R***\*\*
