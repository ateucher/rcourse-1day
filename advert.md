# An Introduction to R for Agrologists: March 7, 2015

This one-day course will introduce users to [R](http://www.r-project.org/) software. The course is suitable for individuals who have never used R, as well those who may have used R in the past but need to brush up on the basics.

## What is R?

R is an open source programming language and environment for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and plotting. In addition to being free (as in speech, eg. open source) it is also free (as in free beer, yay!), which means you can download it and use it for free. It works on all major operating systems including Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Course Content

- R basics including the R environment, basic data structures, and using functions
- Data input and output using csv files
- Installation of external packages to extend R's capabilities
- Data manipulation using the "dplyr" package
- Data plotting using the "ggplot2" package

You will be issued a signed certificate of completion at the end of the course.

## Logistics

You will need to bring a laptop computer with R installed. A course package including software installation instructions will be sent out prior to the course.
